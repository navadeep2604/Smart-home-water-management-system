IoT-Based Water Management System Using ESP32
This project is a smart water management system that automatically controls a water pump and a tap valve based on water levels and flow rate. Additionally, it provides remote manual control through a web interface using the ESP32's built-in WiFi capabilities.
Features
‚úÖ Automatic Water Pump Control - Turns ON/OFF the motor based on the tank water level.
‚úÖ Automatic Tap Overflow Prevention - Closes the valve if excessive water flow is detected.
‚úÖ Web Interface for Remote Control - Users can manually turn the motor ON/OFF via a webpage.
‚úÖ Real-Time Monitoring - Displays water tank level and tap water flow rate on the web interface.

üõ† Components Used
Component	Purpose
ESP32	The main microcontroller, handles everything.
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)	Measures the water level in the tank.
Flow Sensor (YF-S201 or similar)	Detects water flow rate at the tap.
Relay Module (2-Channel)	Controls the motor and the valve.
Water Pump	Fills the tank when needed.
Solenoid Valve	Closes the tap when overflow is detected.
________________________________________ Circuit Connections
Component	ESP32 Pin
Ultrasonic Sensor	
- Trig Pin	GPIO 5
- Echo Pin	GPIO 18
Flow Sensor	GPIO 19
Relay (Motor)	GPIO 23
Relay (Valve)	GPIO 22
Power Connections
‚Ä¢	ESP32 runs on 3.3V.
‚Ä¢	Ultrasonic Sensor and Flow Sensor need 5V.
‚Ä¢	Relays, Pump, and Valve use external 5V or 12V (as per requirement).

Code Explanation
1Ô∏è. Setting Up the Web Server & WiFi
The ESP32 connects to WiFi and hosts a web server on port 80.
cpp
CopyEdit
WebServer server(80);
const char* ssid = "Your_WiFi_SSID";
const char* password = "Your_WiFi_Password";
The web interface allows users to turn the motor ON/OFF manually.
2Ô∏è. Water Level Measurement
The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the tank water level.
cpp
CopyEdit
long getTankLevel() {
    digitalWrite(TRIG_TANK, LOW);
    delayMicroseconds(2);
    digitalWrite(TRIG_TANK, HIGH);
    delayMicroseconds(10);
    digitalWrite(TRIG_TANK, LOW);
    return pulseIn(ECHO_TANK, HIGH) * 0.034 / 2;
}
üí° Formula: Distance = (Time √ó Speed of Sound) √∑ 2
3Ô∏è. Water Flow Detection
The flow sensor generates pulses based on water flow. An interrupt function counts these pulses and calculates flow rate.
cpp
CopyEdit
void IRAM_ATTR flowSensorISR() {
    flowPulseCount++;
}
Every second, the flow rate is updated:
cpp
CopyEdit
flowRate = (flowPulseCount / 7.5); // Adjust for sensor calibration
flowPulseCount = 0;
4Ô∏è. Automatic Motor & Valve Control
‚Ä¢	Motor turns ON when water level exceeds 40 cm.
‚Ä¢	Motor turns OFF when water level drops below 10 cm.
cpp
CopyEdit
if (tankLevel > 40) {
    digitalWrite(RELAY_MOTOR, LOW);
} else if (tankLevel < 10) {
    digitalWrite(RELAY_MOTOR, HIGH);
}
‚Ä¢	If water flow exceeds 10 L/min, the valve closes to prevent overflow.
cpp
CopyEdit
if (flowRate > 10) {
    digitalWrite(RELAY_VALVE, LOW);
} else {
    digitalWrite(RELAY_VALVE, HIGH);
}
5Ô∏è. Web Interface for Manual Control
The ESP32 serves a basic webpage where users can turn ON/OFF the motor.
cpp
CopyEdit
void handleRoot() {
    String html = "<html><body><h2>Water Management System</h2>";
    html += "<p><a href='/motor/on'>Turn ON Motor</a></p>";
    html += "<p><a href='/motor/off'>Turn OFF Motor</a></p>";
    html += "<p>Water Tank Level: " + String(getTankLevel()) + " cm</p>";
    html += "<p>Tap Water Flow Rate: " + String(flowRate) + " L/min</p>";
    html += "</body></html>";
    server.send(200, "text/html", html);
}
üöÄ When a user clicks Turn ON Motor, this function runs:
cpp
CopyEdit
void motorOn() {
    digitalWrite(RELAY_MOTOR, LOW);
    server.send(200, "text/html", "<p>Motor Turned ON</p><a href='/'>Back</a>");
}
For Turn OFF Motor, this function runs:
cpp
CopyEdit
void motorOff() {
    digitalWrite(RELAY_MOTOR, HIGH);
    server.send(200, "text/html", "<p>Motor Turned OFF</p><a href='/'>Back</a>");
}
This lets the user manually control the motor unless the automatic logic overrides it.
